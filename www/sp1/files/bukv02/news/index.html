        Deep Rock Galactic: Season 06 is coming soon.<br><br>
        For a while now we’ve said that we won’t be looking at Season 06 until we get Rogue Core out in Early Access. That wasn’t exactly true. We have been looking into it – we just didn’t want to make any announcements until we knew for sure we were running with it.<br><br>
        Season 06 is confirmed, and it’s coming before Rogue Core's early access launch (more on that later). We’re currently aiming for a S06 release date in Q1 2026.
        The reason we’re now able to work on Deep Rock Galactic and Rogue Core at the same time is because we’ve brought in reinforcements from our neighboring Danish developers, Invisible Walls.<br><br>
        We’ve wanted Season 06 as much as anyone, but we kept having to face the fact that we simply don’t have enough people at Ghost Ship Games to work on Deep Rock Galactic and Rogue Core at the same time. We tried it and it was clunky and stressful. If we wanted to have our cake and eat it too, we’d either need to interview, hire and train 10-15 more employees… or we could ask for help from our friends.<br><br>
        Bringing in Invisible Walls was the natural choice for us. They’re people we know and trust, they’ve played loads of DRG, their office is a 15-minute walk from ours, and we feel like we’re aligned on what makes a good game and a nice working experience. All that makes it easy for us to work together. They’ve been talking with our programmers, game designers and artists for the past half year to learn the arcane ways of DRG’s code, and they’re taking on most of the work for this upcoming season, with direction from GSG’s Game Director Mikkel and Lead Game Designer Mike.<br><br>
        And it goes without saying that we’re very impressed with their work so far. Soon, we will a closer look and see what’s coming in Season 06: RELICS OF HOXXES.

        <h2>Reminder: Tune in to 'On the Horizon' this Thursday for some big DRG news</h2>

        Hello Miners,<br><br>
        Just a quick reminder that we’re only two days from our big On the Horizon livestream! And we'd love for you to join us. We’ve got some news about Deep Rock Galactic and Rogue Core that we think you’ll be interested in.<br><br>
        We were going to post a detailed agenda like we usually do, but we couldn’t figure out a way to share more specifics that didn’t end up spoiling the announcements we’ve got planned. Also we ran out of time. So, as the old adage goes, “F*** it, we’ll do it live!”<br><br>
        We’ve set up a video premiere on YouTube, so you can join in advance and catch the stream right when it starts. Steam won't let us embed a premiere-style video, so you'll have to click here to catch it on YouTube. We’ll also be streaming on Twitch too, and keeping an eye on both chats for your comments and questions.<br><br>
        It’s all going down this Thursday, November 13th at 17:00 CET.<br><br>
        Rock and Stone!<br><br>
