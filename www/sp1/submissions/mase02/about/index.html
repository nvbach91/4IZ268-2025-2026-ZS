            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>
                Karetus is a Portuguese electronic music duo formed in 2010 by DJs and record producers Carlos Silva and
                André Reis. Originally emerging from the Lisbon area, the project quickly became known for a high-energy
                blend of bass-driven electronic music and references to Portuguese popular culture, as well as for a
                visually striking live show built around masks inspired by the traditional caretos of north-eastern
                Portugal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 2010 the duo have released a string of EPs and singles on labels such as Rottun Recordings and
                Buygore, as well as the album Piñata (2015). Over the years Karetus have toured extensively across
                Portugal and internationally, performing at clubs and festivals in Europe, Asia and South America. In
                2021 they competed in the Portuguese national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, Festival da
                Canção, with the song "Saudade", performed with Romeu Bairos.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the mid-2020s the duo began developing Modas, a concept album that reimagines melodies from oral
                tradition, historical repertoire and folklore, placing them within contemporary electronic production.
                The project was introduced through the singles "Laurinda" (2024), with Vitorino and iolanda, and
                "Moleirinha" (2025), featuring Conan Osiris, Isabel Silvestre with Vozes de Manhouce and Júlio Pereira,
                both presented as previews of the forthcoming album Modas scheduled for release in 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karetus are also noted for their live visual identity, which combines custom-designed costumes with
                masks referencing the universe of the caretos, and a stage aesthetic that places traditional
                craftsmanship alongside digital technology.
