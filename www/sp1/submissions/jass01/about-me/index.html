          <p>
            I'm Samuel - a web developer, student, and rider who finds freedom
            on two wheels. When I'm not buried in code, I'm out chasing quiet
            roads, mountain passes, or just a good view with friends. This blog
            is where I mix both worlds - sharing my passion for motorcycles,
            travel, and the little adventures that make life more than just
            routine.

          <h2>My motorcycling journey</h2>
          <p>
            My motorcycling journey started about 1.5 years ago, when I decided
            to get my A2 license (EU standard - bikes up to 35KW). This was
            kinda of a spur of the moment decision, as I was thinking about
            unique ways I could see the world, and motorcycling seemed like a
            fun and adventerous way to travel. After getting my license, I was
            looking for bikes that would fit my requirements, but not break the
            bank at the same time. My budget was quite tight, so options were
            limited, but after looking for about 2 months I ended up finding a
            1999 Kawasaki ER5 and instantly fell in love with it. The bike was
            in rough condition. The tires, brakes, oil, and filters needed to be
            replaced, but the frame and engine were intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, after getting the bike I ended up breaking my leg on
            my scooter, and was out of the season for the whole summer. Which is
            why my adventures with the bike are very limited, and most of the
            trip tips I share are trips I am still planning myself. However, I
            look forward to undergoing them in the next season and enjoying
            every moment on my bike!

            <h3>✈️ Travelling</h3>
            <p>
              Travelling is one of the reasons I even got into motorcycling, as
              I mentioned above. I love seeing new places, discovering new
              cultures and experiencing things for the first time. There's so
              much out there to see and I want to experience all of it. As is
              sometimes said - the good, the bad and the ugly. Currently, I
              would love to visit a south american country in the near future,
              as it's a culture I find is very close to my heart.

            <h3>🎵 Music</h3>
            <p>
              Music is truly something I could never live without. Whether I'm
              sad, happy, excited, or feel any other emotion, music is something
              I find comfort in. According to Spotify wrapped, in 2025 I
              listened to music for 4 hours a day on average. When I broke my
              leg in june, I also picked up playing the guitar, which is
              something I've been enjoying a lot lately, and am trying to
              practice for at least an hour a day.

            <h3>🔪 Cooking</h3>
            <p>
              This is a hobby for me that allows me to disconnect and just focus
              on another thing I love - food. As much as I enjoy the process of
              cooking (can't say the same thing about baking, though), the final
              product is the most important thing for me. I enjoy cooking good
              food, making sure it's plated nicely and has a "restaurant" feel.
              It also makes me happy seeing other people eat and enjoy my food.
