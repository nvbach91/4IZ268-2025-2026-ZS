            Music Club is a place for bands, solo singers and music fans who want to enjoy live shows,
            meet new people and create unforgettable evenings. We organise concerts, jam sessions and

            Our goal is to support local artists and give them a stage with good sound, friendly audience
            and strong atmosphere. Everyone who loves music is welcome – listeners, performers and volunteers.
